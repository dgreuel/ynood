# YNOOD: You Need Out of Debt
You Need Out of Debt is an integration developed for the YNAB API contest. It integrates with a private-label version of Undebt.it to sync YNAB debt account data and allow users to create and follow a detailed debt payoff plan based on the Snowball/Avalanche methods.

## demo
Note: the code in this repository depends on a number of environment variables (API keys, etc.) that are kept secret, and will therefore not work as is. To see a working live demo, go to:

2) Register for a YNOOD account
